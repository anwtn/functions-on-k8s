# Azure Functions on K8s

## Introduction

This project provides:

1. a simple Azure Function with a queue listener
2. a set of instructions for deploying the function to a k8s cluster, optionally using AKS
3. a test program for adding messages to the queue

## Creating a function with a Docker file

This step is optional, but it explains how to create a Docker enable function.

You will need to have the Azure Function CLI installed to use the `func` tools. You can find the [Azure Functions Core Tools installation instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

Instructions for creating a [k8s enabled function can be found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-kubernetes-keda).

The commands in this documentation are similar to what you will find in the [Azure Functions command line quick-start](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-csharp?tabs=azure-cli%2Cbrowser&source=docs), but are specific for creating a Dockerised function app.

Once you have installed the tools, you can initialize a new Azure Functions project - with Docker support - by running the following command:

`func init ReviewsWorkerFunctionApp --dotnet --docker`

The `./ReviewsWorkerFunctionApp` sub-directory will be generated via the previous command, containing the scaffolding for a function app. Use:

`cd ./ReviewsWorkerFunctionApp`

...to change to this directory.

For the purposes of this demo, we will create a simple Azure Storage Queue listener. We can add a new storage queue listener function with the following command from within:

`func new`

A list of template options will be provided - choose:
 `QueueTrigger`

...and for the name we will use:
`ReviewQueueListener`

The purposes of this function will be to listen to messages from a reviews queue, which we will populate in a moment.
